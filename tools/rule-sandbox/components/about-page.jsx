					To get started, you will need to provide a LookML project to lint against, under the project tab.
					To avoid having to abstract and display a view of multiple, the app currently accepts a JSON representation of your entire project, as output by
					node-lookml-parser, rather than the raw LookML. So, you will want to run the parser on your project from the command line.

				cd ~/your/project
				lookml-parser --file-output=by-name --whitespace=4 --transform=x
				# or --transform=xs if you wish to ignore/drop $strings data`}
				</code>
			<Typography>
				Depending on your operating system, you may find it convenient to pipe the output of the parser directly to your clipboard

				In the rule tab, enter the match JSON Path and Liyad rule expression as you would
